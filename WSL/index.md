# Windows Subsystem for Linux Documentation

Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) lets developers run a GNU/Linux environment -- including most command-line tools, utilities, and applications -- directly on Windows, unmodified, without the overhead of a traditional virtual machine or dual-boot setup.

## Try WSL preview features by joining the Windows Insiders Program

To try the most recent features or updates to WSL, join the [Windows Insiders Program](https://insider.windows.com/getting-started). Once you have joined Windows Insiders, you can choose the channel you would like to receive preview builds from inside the Windows settings menu. You can choose from:

* Dev channel: Most recent updates, but low stability.
* Beta channel: Ideal for early adopters, more reliable builds than the Dev channel.
* Release Preview channel: Preview fixes and key features on the next version of Windows just before its available to the general public.
